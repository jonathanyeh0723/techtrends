# Docker For Application Packaging

## Why Container and Container Orchestration?

Once a team has developed an application, the next phase is to move on to the release process. This includes techniques for:
 - service packaging 
 - containerization
 - distribution

The end result of a product release is represented by a service that is deployed in a production environment and can be accessed by consumers.
